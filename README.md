## REST API

At the moment the api supports queries for algorithms and datastructures. Responses are in JSON format.

To get a lits of all entries simply navigate to:  
```
//[server]/api
```

List of all algorithms or datastructures can be accessed by:
```
//[server]/api/algorithms  
//[server]/api/datastructures
```

A single entry:  
```
//[server]/api/algorithms/[algorithm name]
//[server]/api/datastructures/[datastructure name]
```
